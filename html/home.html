				<p><span style="color:red;"> Just a notice for all of those who may be browsing this site; it is by no means complete.
					There are certain facets and pieces of information that may seem out of place or not present. These things will be
					weeded out over time, and if they aren't, contact the address below with any inquiries. Also, I am aware that the
					menu bar is 100% broken. The transition between repl and github is not the smoothest.

					Hello! Welcome to the Minecraft server Voxel Wars' official website. These hosting services are provided by github, 
					a website for the proliferation of youth knowledge of programming. This site was created solely by the creator of the
					server, PFunk_, with assorted assistance by friends and teachers.
				</p><p>
					The server is hosted using a service known as server.pro. It is a great way to put up a server, with a ton of options
					for what you might want. In fact, there are free options for servers! They must be renewed hourly, however, and if 
					they are not renewed, they are taken offline. You also must wait in a queue, since there are a limited number of 
					these servers available. It is highly recommended that if you wish to create a permanent site, pay a small monthly 
					fee (5$/month) to run a server indefinitely. Look up the site and create an account to learn more, since an account 
					is free. I'm not sponsored.
				</p><p>
					Server IP address : 192.99.18.215:40833. Keep in mind the type of IP address that this is while you decide whether to
					join. A whitelist is enforced, meaning you must contact me with your username and another player who told you about
					the server. You will be added to the whitelist soon enough, in which case I will respond.
