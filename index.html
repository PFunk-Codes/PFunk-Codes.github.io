						Hello! Welcome to the Minecraft server Voxel Wars' official website. These hosting services are provided by repl.it, 
						a website for the proliferation of youth knowledge of programming. This site was created solely by the creator of the
						server, PFunk_, with assorted assistance by friends and teachers. This site is also primitive, so it is unipage for
						the time being. However, most of the information you need for the server will be present.
					</p>
						The server is hosted using a service known as server.pro. It is a great way to put up a server, with a ton of options
						for what you might want. In fact, there are free options for servers! They must be renewed hourly, however, and if 
						they are not renewed, they are taken offline. You also must wait in a queue, since there are a limited number of 
						these servers available. It is highly recommended that if you wish to create a permanent site, pay a small monthly 
						fee (5$/month) to run a server indefinitely. Look up the site and create an account to learn more, since an account 
						is free. I'm not sponsored.
					</p><p>
						Server IP address : 192.99.18.215:40833. Keep in mind the type of IP address that this is while you decide whether to
						join.
